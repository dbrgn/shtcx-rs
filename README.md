This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the Sensirion SHTCx and SHTWx
temperature / humidity sensor series, based on the
[`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.

Tested with the following sensors:

- [SHTC1](https://www.sensirion.com/shtc1/)
- [SHTC3](https://www.sensirion.com/shtc3/)
- [SHTW2](https://www.sensirion.com/shtw2/)

Docs: https://docs.rs/shtcx

## The Device

The Sensirion SHTCx series offers low-power high-precision digital temperature
and humidity sensors that communicate over the IÂ²C bus.

The SHTWx series uses the same protocol, but in a wafer-level chip-scale
package (WLCSP).

## Status

- [x] Measure temperature and humidity
- [x] Get device identifier
- [x] Sleep / Wakeup commands
- [x] Soft reset command
- [x] Support for low power mode
- [x] CRC checks
- [x] Docs

## Examples

There are a few examples in the `examples` directory: The `linux-<target>`
example queries the sensor a few times using `linux-embedded-hal`, while the
`monitor-<target>` example implements a terminal based real-time graphical
temperature/humidity monitoring tool.
